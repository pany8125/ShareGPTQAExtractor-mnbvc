For example, it is the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of different triangular numbers[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_(number)), and it is a master number that represents pure love in New Age numerology[2](https://thewordcounter.com/meaning-of-33/) [3](https://www.numerology.com/articles/about-numerology/master-number-33/). It is also the title of a song by Polo G[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUe2cdhsL68)."
