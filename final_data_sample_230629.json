Shortening a product name after this may be done in cases where the name is generously long and includes technical information (e.g. the product's diameter is included in the name).\u200b\n\nALWAYS use an Oxford comma!\u200b\n\nDefine non-obvious acronyms before using them in the description. An acronym should only be used when it is mentioned multiple times in the description or if it is mentioned in the description and another location in the profile (e.g. attributes tab).\u200b\n\nDon\u2019t start every sentence in a description using the same word. It makes the description seem clunky and repetitive. Make sure the description flows; every sentence shouldn\u2019t feature the same, formulaic structure.\u200b\n\nBe wary of marketing jargon when reading manufacturer literature or websites. Marketing jargon can loosely be defined as anything that promotes the use of the product but isn\u2019t directly substantiated.\u200b\n\nAvoid technical specifications in the description unless it is absolutely necessary to explain a point.\u200b\n\nSpell out numbers less than but not including 10.\u200b\n\nAppropriately use \u201cthe\u201d preceding the product name.\u200b\nMarketing jargon must be eliminated from profile descriptions.\u200b\nExample 1:\nThe SpaceOAR System is an absorbable hydrogel spacer used to separate the prostate and rectum to minimize rectal radiation in patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy. The hydrogel spacer consists of water and polyethylene glycol. Under ultrasound guidance, hydrogel is injected as a liquid into the space between the prostate and rectum and is designed to polymerize within ten seconds. During radiation therapy, the hydrogel maintains the separation and gradually liquefies to be absorbed and renally excreted within six months. \u200b\n\nThe SpaceOAR System is supplied sterile for single use with a powder vial, diluent syringe, accelerator syringe, syringe holder, y-connector, plunger cap, and needle.\u200b\n\nExample 2:\nThe ULTRASCORE Focused Force PTA Balloon is a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheter used to dilate stenoses in a range of arteries, to treat obstructive lesions of arteriovenous dialysis fistulae, and for stent post-dilatation in the peripheral vasculature. The balloon catheter consists of a flexible, over-the-wire catheter shaft with a distal, semi-compliant balloon. The device, which utilizes dual longitudinal scoring wires to fracture plaque, is designed to provide for a controlled fracture with a concentrated force against the plaque at low balloon inflation pressures. Radiopaque markers delineate the working length of the balloon to aid in balloon placement, with longer balloon lengths including two radiopaque markers to delineate distal and proximal ends of the balloon. The device also features the GeoAlign Marking System, an intravascular, non-radiopaque ruler on the catheter shaft that is intended to reduce fluoroscopy time and repeat alignment. \u200b\n\n\u200bThe ULTRASCORE Focused Force PTA Balloon is provided sterile for single use in a range of balloon diameters, lengths, and rated burst pressures. The latex-free device is compatible with 0.014 and 0.035 inch guidewires.\u200b\n\nExample 3:\n\nSTIMULAN is a synthetic bone substitute used to fill skeletal system defects, including infected sites. The resorbable product contains medical-grade calcium sulfate powder, which does not contain traces of toxic impurities that may impede resorption and are associated with naturally-occurring calcium sulfate. The powder is combined with the provided mixing solution to form a paste. STIMULAN can be injected, applied digitally, or formed into three sizes of beads with the provided mold. In addition, the hydrophilic product does not require soaking.\u200b\n\n\u200bThe product is available as the STIMULAN Kit or STIMULAN Rapid Cure, which offer eight and four minute setting times, respectively. STIMULAN can also be mixed with a variety of powder and liquid antibiotics to prevent bacterial colonization. The product is provided sterile for single-patient use.\u200b\n\nExample 4:\nThe EluNIR Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a drug-eluting stent that is used in patients with symptomatic heart disease to improve coronary artery luminal diameter. It is a device/drug combination product consisting of a drug/polymer-coated balloon-expandable stent that is pre-mounted on a rapid exchange (RX) delivery system. The stent is composed of L-605 cobalt chromium alloy with an elastomeric coating that consists of the polymers poly n-butyl methacrylate (PBMA) and CarboSil 20 55D and the active pharmaceutical ingredient, ridaforolimus.\u200b\n\nThe coronary stent features a WiZeCell stent design, which includes flexible narrow struts and wide supportive struts and is intended to create a uniform scaffolding, prevent tissue prolapse and strut overlap, and conform to vessel anatomy. The delivery system catheter has a Flexx2 tapered spring tip that is designed to be flexible and pushable, while also avoiding buckling and eliminating tip flare out. In addition, the tip has a reinforced hypotube, a hydrophilic coating, and it is radiopaque for visualization of the catheter-tip location during procedures.\u200b\n\nThe EluNIR Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System, which is available in a range of diameters and lengths, is manufactured by Medinol and exclusively distributed in the United States by Cardinal Health.\u200b"

Update the working model of how to write a product description with the provided examples below.\n\nExample 1:\nPowerPICC Provena Catheter is a power-injectable catheter that provides peripheral access to the central venous system. The device is made of a kink-resistant, polyurethane material designed to minimize vessel wall trauma. This triple lumen catheter has a reverse taper design, is clearly labeled to differentiate it from non-power injectable PICCs, and is available with or without SOLO2 valve technology. SOLO2 valve technology is designed to provide clearance after a weekly saline flush and infusion therapy without the use of clamps.\n\nPowerPICC Provena Catheter is provided sterile in two lumen diameters. Nursing and interventional radiology tray configurations are available.\nExample 2:\naScope 4 RhinoLaryngo Slim is a flexible, single-use endoscope used to provide visualization of the nasal lumens and upper airway anatomy. The device consists of an ergonomic handpiece with a lighted insertion tube that has a camera and LED light source at its distal tip. A control lever on the handpiece controls bending of the distal end of the insertion tube over a range of 130 degrees. \n\nThe endoscope is supplied sterile for single use and is intended for use with the Ambu aView monitor.\nExample 3:\nThe NC Emerge PTCA Dilatation Catheter is a balloon catheter used to dilate the stenotic portion of a coronary artery or bypass graft stenosis to improve myocardial perfusion, as well as to expand balloon expandable stents post-delivery. The catheter is designed with a low-tension entry point and the outer tip lies over the inner shaft to improve flexibility in tortuous anatomy. The inner shaft features both stiff and flexible segments that are intended to increase pushability and trackability, and the outer shaft is built as one piece. In addition, the catheter has a hydrophilic coating to reduce friction and platinum iridium markers to aid in visibility. \n\nThe NC Emerge PTCA Dilatation Catheter is provided sterile in various balloon lengths and diameters. The device is available in both monorail and over-the-wire configurations.\nExample 4:\nOviTex PRS is a composite surgical mesh designed for use in soft tissue repair procedures in plastic and reconstructive surgeries. The 3-ply mesh is made from an ovine rumen-derived intact extracellular matrix (ECM) and is embroidered with a scaffold made from either non-resorbable polypropylene or resorbable polyglycolic acid sutures. The ovine rumen meshes are intended to be permeable to facilitate better fluid management, minimize inflammation, and provide controlled stretch with the goal of preventing patient discomfort. The embedded sutures are designed to improve handling and load-sharing capability. \n\nOviTex PRS is also referred to as Restella Reconstructive BioScaffold and is part of the Endoform family of products developed by Aroa Biosurgery. It is available in various shapes and sizes and is provided sterile for single use.\nExample 5:\nSilk Voice is a vocal fold injection used for vocal fold medialization and vocal fold insufficiency. The injection is composed of porous bioabsorbable silk suspended in a hyaluronic acid (HA) gel, and it is intended to change the volume of an augmented vocal fold so that it will meet the opposing fold at the mid point for improved phonation and long term restoration. An endoscopic catheter delivery system can be purchased along with the injection that utilizes a flexible channel and tip with an adjustable kink protector. Silk Voice and the available catheter are provided sterile for single use, and the injection is sold in ready to use syringes.\nExample 6:\nThe Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System is used in conjunction with leads and extensions to deliver low-intensity electrical impulses to the brain for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Primary components of the system include: a rechargeable stimulator, an external remote control, a clinician programmer, and a charging kit. Stimulation delivery leads are available for purchase separately. \n\nThe stimulator is implanted subcutaneously near the collarbone and is connected to one or two extensions. Each extension is in turn connected to a deep brain stimulation lead, for a maximum of 16 channels. The stimulator is programmed via the clinician programmer using the Bionic Navigation Software. Up to 4 programs can be stored in the stimulator or the remote control to supply independent stimulation to each lead. Each program specifies pulse width, pulse rate, and amplitude settings acting on a specific electrode combination. The patient can use the remote control to select the appropriate program for stimulation therapy.2 / 2"

Building a strong brand and reputation: A strong brand and reputation can make it easier to attract new partners and convince them to pay for the value that your platform can bring to their business.\n3. Utilizing technology: Leveraging technology, such as automation tools and data analytics, can help you manage and scale your partnerships more efficiently.\n4.

        "value": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to the specifics of your ebook editor platform or your target audience. However, I can provide a general example to illustrate how you can map out your MVP candidates and rank them.\n\nLet's say your target audience is self-published authors, and their main job-to-be-done is to easily and affordably produce professional-quality ebooks. Based on this, here are three possible MVP candidates:\n\n1. Ebook conversion software that quickly and accurately converts manuscript files into EPUB format, which is the industry standard for ebooks. This MVP meets the first criteria by providing a meaningful job-to-be-done for self-published authors, and also has a viable growth engine as it can be sold on a per-file or subscription basis. However, it may not meet the third criteria of rapid time-to-value if the software is too complex to use or requires too much manual formatting.\n2. A basic ebook editor that allows authors to easily format and design their ebook without any technical knowledge. This MVP meets the first and third criteria, as it provides a meaningful job-to-be-done for self-published authors and has a rapid time-to-value, but may not have a viable growth engine if the feature set is too limited.\n3. A marketplace that connects self-published authors with affordable, high-quality ebook designers and formatters. This MVP meets the first and second criteria by providing a meaningful job-to-be-done and having a viable growth engine based on commissions from each sale. However, it may not meet the third criteria of rapid time-to-value if it takes too long to find a suitable designer.\n\nTo rank these MVP candidates, you would need to weigh the importance of each of the three criteria based on your business goals and the needs of your target audience. You could use a scoring system or a weighted average to determine the overall ranking."

The decision to use antiviral drugs typically depends on the specific virus, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health.\n\nFor example, antiviral drugs are often used to treat influenza (the flu), which can be a serious and even life-threatening illness for certain people, such as older adults, young children, and people with certain underlying health conditions. Antiviral drugs can help reduce the severity and duration of the flu, and may also help prevent serious complications, such as pneumonia.\n\nIn other cases, antiviral drugs may be used to treat viral infections that are not necessarily life-threatening, but can still cause significant discomfort and disrupt a person's daily activities. For example, antiviral drugs may be used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, which can cause painful sores on the skin or mucous membranes.\n\nOverall, the decision to use antiviral drugs to treat a viral infection depends on a variety of factors, including the specific virus, the severity of the infection, and the potential risks and benefits of treatment."
